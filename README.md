For this project, I was tasked with developing a prototype for BrainFlix, a new video streaming platform, within a tight three-week timeline. I utilized provided mockups to create a responsive app prototype using HTML, CSS, and React. After initial feedback, I integrated a mock API to display hard-coded movie data and implemented functionality for adding new video content. In the final sprint, I transitioned to building a custom API to manage video data, enhancing the prototype's capabilities and ensuring a seamless client-server interaction.![BrainFlix-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8c81143-392d-4613-a937-39e22dbdeeef)
